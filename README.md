### Project Overview

In this project, I developed a simple email classification app that categorizes user-submitted emails as either spam or not-spam. To achieve this, I trained a machine learning model on pre-processed data, evaluated its performance, and successfully optimized it, reducing the error rate by 25%. The final model was exported using joblib and integrated into a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter.

### Documentation

For a detailed explanation of the project, please refer to the documentation.ipynb file. It is a Jupyter notebook that walks through each step of the app development process. This is my first time creating documentation, and I found it to be a valuable learning experience. Any suggestions for improvement are highly appreciated!

### How to Set Up and Test the App:

1.	Clone or download the app_files repository.
2.	Run the GUI.py script.
3.	The app should now be up and running!
