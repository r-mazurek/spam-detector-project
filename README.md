### Spam Detection Personal Project

This project is a spam detection tool bundled with a simple and intuitive GUI. The app allows users to input an email along with its subject, evaluate whether it is likely to be spam or not, and display the result.

### Project Overview

The spam detection tool uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes machine learning model to label emails as spam or ham (meaning not-spam), based on both the subject and the message. The model was trained on a publicly available dataset of labeled emails (credited in the documentation) and can be run on a simple GUI designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind.
